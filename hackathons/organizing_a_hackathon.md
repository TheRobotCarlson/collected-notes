# Organizing a hackathon
These are notes that I've started taking on organizing a hackathon from my experience with organizing Cathacks. This isn't an exhaustive list, nor is it guaranteed to be the correct thing to do in all circumstances. This is simply a record of my experience and the steps taken. I'll try to add feedback to parts as I find whether they ended up being good or bad decisions.

### Career Fairs
Companies attend career fairs because they're looking for employees, interns, coops, or some combination of those. To get into a career fair, companies typically have to pay the organizing party. Companies pay UK to attend the career fair, for example. This implies that they have a university recruitment budget and are searching for talent. 
Usually career fairs are followed up by emails and interviews over some long time period. Companies tend to also have a PR or marketing budget that is spent on getting excitement up about the company or exposing their products and tools.

Hackathons fill an efficiency gap that employers may not realize exists: recruiting spending, interview spending, and marketing + PR spending could all be rolled up into one. Hackathons provide the opportunity to do brand exposure, recruiting exploration, on-site interviews, and marketing about a company's products.

#### Points to emphasize
- Students attending hackathons are going the extra mile
