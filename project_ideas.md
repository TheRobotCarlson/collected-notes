# Project ideas
Aggregation of project ideas thought of since 9/9/2018

## [Robocode](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode) clone
Like hackerrank or kaggle, but for algorithms and AI practice.
See [Headfake learning](learning_activities.md#headfake).

Would be great tool for teaching algorithms and AI. Possibly modify 
the type of game to make it more school friendly. Maybe an exploration
game. 

### Features:
- Free and open source
- Easy ranking system
- Expandable challenges
    - battles
    - mazes
    - exploration games
    - persistent learning
- Easy setup
- Compatible with multiple languages
    - web based "Scratch programming"
    - java
    - C++?
    - JS
    - python

## smart garden
- tells when plants are ready to be picked
- waters / fertilizes if needed
- tells if garden needs to be weeded
- could go the path of full automation
    - autoplanting
    - autoharvesting
    - done on industrial scale [already](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/07/world/automated-farm-harvest-england/index.html)
    - would only work with certain vegetables
    - done at home too, but [expensive](https://farm.bot/)
- mostly conceptual work with small demo
- combining MIT [food computers](https://wiki.openag.media.mit.edu/personal_food_computers)
    - [$300 implementation](https://forum.openag.media.mit.edu/t/300-food-computer-mvp/2343)
- large scale [food servers](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/food-server/overview/)

## meal planner with optimizing steps
- optimizes for different things 
    - budget
    - least dirty dishes
    - nutrients
    - leftovers
    - minimal waste
    - weighted combination
- weekly / monthly
- "with what's in your fridge"

## meal making assistant
- steps of recipe
- learns how long you take to do certain tasks
- reminds you how to do certain routines
- lets you know if you're ready tp d
