## make a better [notes](https://github.com/pimterry/notes)-like tool
- full feature set of notes

### crucial features:
- git sync
- folder support
- metadata/tagging
- "source" changing, like private notes vs public ones

### cool features
- taskwarrior integration
- prereqs / blocking


## [Robocode](http://robowiki.net/wiki/Robocode) clone
Like hackerrank or kaggle, but for algorithms and AI practice.
See [Headfake learning](learning_activities.md#headfake).

Would be great tool for teaching algorithms and AI. Possibly modify 
the type of game to make it more school friendly. Maybe an exploration
game. 

### Features:
- Free and open source
- Easy ranking system
- Expandable challenges
    - battles
    - mazes
    - exploration games
    - persistent learning
- Easy setup
- Compatible with multiple languages
    - web based "Scratch programming"
    - java
    - C++?
    - JS
    - python



## smart garden
- tells when plants are ready to be picked
- waters / fertilizes if needed
- tells if garden needs to be weeded
- could go the path of full automation
    - autoplanting
    - autoharvesting
    - done on industrial scale [already](https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/07/world/automated-farm-harvest-england/index.html)
    - would only work with certain vegetables
    - done at home too, but [expensive](https://farm.bot/)
- mostly conceptual work with small demo
- combining MIT [food computers](https://wiki.openag.media.mit.edu/personal_food_computers)
    - [$300 implementation](https://forum.openag.media.mit.edu/t/300-food-computer-mvp/2343)
- large scale [food servers](https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/food-server/overview/)


## meal planner with optimizing steps
- optimizes for different things 
    - budget
    - least dirty dishes
    - nutrients
    - leftovers
    - minimal waste
    - weighted combination

- "with what's in your fridge"


## meal making assistant
- steps of recipe
- learns how long you take to do certain tasks
- reminds you how to do certain routines

## Command line productivity assist
Taskwarrior works well for managing tasks, clearing the clutter involved with todo managers. The Notes project mentioned above works well for getting things done without getting in the way of productivity. There are still some things lacking from both of these tools that could be aggregated into one unified, modular, command line productivity platform.
- integrates google calendar
- planning application for events / work
- integrates taskwarrior
- integrates notes notetaking
- groups tasks, deadlines, and notes into projects and contexts
- integrates git manager for syncing between machines and for backup
    - optional git managers
- provides options for online hosting, but not required
    - create shareable links
    - better graphs for display
    - integrates with rescuetime, other time tracking apps.
        - maybe custom time tracking solution
- email or text notifications, but not required
- potentially work with exist.io or provide custom insights and suggestions
- pipe-able
- simple, parseable files to allow modularity and customization
- email follow up integration
- searchable tags

## UKY ACM Blog
The ACM is always doing things that sometimes go unnoticed. We have members that participate in hackathons and do well. We run awesome workshops. We have fun game nights. Starting a blog for government members to publish information about what we've been up to would be a great way to both communicate to the public what we've been doing and provide inspiration for other CS students here at UK. It also provides a good template for the future ACM government for activities and feedback..
- Easy to contribute to, markdown
- Ability to have comments for feedback on posts
- Revamp of the website in the process
