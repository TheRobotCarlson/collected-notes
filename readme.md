# Brian's Collected Notes
This is a collection of my notes from across projects, ideas, homework, thoughts. The repo is being filled from 9/9/2018 onward.

This repo is created using the command line [notes tool](https://github.com/pimterry/notes) and a simple aliased git sync script

I release everything in this repo to the public domain

## Why?
Mostly practical reasons:
- sharing my thoughts / ideas 
- making collaborations easier.
- aggregating all the stuff I do to one location
- collecting resources that I can use anywhere with an internet connection
- making it easy to read / access / write to anywhere with an internet connection
- making it easy to sync across devices

For some silly reasons:
- if I have an idea, there's a public record of when I came up with it. (no patents)
- companies can see what I do in my free time
- maybe people will find it helpful?
