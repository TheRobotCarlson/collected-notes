# Productivity
My notes on productivity beginning on 9/26/2018 and moving forward.

## Tools
- [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/) has been a big help for me for managing stuff I have to do and prioritizing based on due dates and urgency
- [Rescuetime](https://rescuetime.com) has helped me keep track of how much time I'm allocating to various projects and how much time I'm wasting. 
    - For the people that are serious about optimizing their productive hours, this is a really good tool for catching trends you miss. I didn't realize I spent so much time on hackernews when I was supposed to be working because it feels "productive" despite being non-work related. Very insightful
    - also gives an api that you can use to gain insights into your own data if you want
- bash shell - a weird one, but I can quickly take notes, sync, and share from my github when everything is set up properly. Taskwarrior is in the shell. I can ssh into servers, quickly run small bits of code from most languages, and do most computer things pretty quickly.
- [Exist.io](https://exist.io) provides correlations between different data sources and your productivity levels, fitness levels, or whatever else you want it to track.
    - integrates a lot of services, including the weather, spotify/last.fm, rescuetime
    - provides an API for leveraging your data


## Habit Formation
- Don't try to change too many things at once. 
    - This is a sure way to fail at changing any of them permanently. Often your enthusiasm causes you to want to take on many things at once, but the enthusiasm and the drive it brought with it is highly dependent on mental state and fades quickly when put under pressure.
