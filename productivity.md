# Productivity
My notes on productivity beginning on 9/26/2018 and moving forward.

## Tools
- [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/) has been a big help for me for managing stuff I have to do and prioritizing based on due dates and urgency
- [Rescuetime](https://rescuetime.com) has helped me keep track of how much time I'm allocating to various projects and how much time I'm wasting. 
    - For the people that are serious about optimizing their productive hours, this is a really good tool for catching trends you miss. I didn't realize I spent so much time on hackernews when I was supposed to be working because it feels "productive" despite being non-work related. Very insightful
    - also gives an api that you can use to gain insights into your own data if you want
- bash shell - a weird one, but I can quickly take notes, sync, and share from my github when everything is set up properly. Taskwarrior is in the shell. I can ssh into servers, quickly run small bits of code from most languages, and do most computer things pretty quickly.
