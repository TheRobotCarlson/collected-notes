# Universal Basic Income
Notes on UBI from 11/29/2018. Primarily research for a persuasion class. It's frustrating how hard it was to get real data for the report.

## The world is a positive sum game now
"Over the last 20 years, all G7 economies increased their per capita income. Almost three-quarters of the increase in each country was due to a common improvement in prosperity. Only 27% was due to a change in the relative prosperity of the countries." - [source](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/01/win-win-world/)

"advances in wealth or wellbeing in one part of the world are likely to enhance prospects for progress elsewhere rather than hurt them." - [source](https://www.cgdev.org/blog/upside-down-and-positive-sum-world)

## UBI could be a better welfare system
- "In FY 2019 total US government spending on welfare — federal, state, and local — is “guesstimated” to be $1,179 billion, including $721 billion for Medicaid, and $458 billion in other welfare." - [source](https://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_welfare_spending_40.html)

- "On average, administrative costs are less than 10 percent of means-tested cash, food, housing, and medical spending." - [source](https://www.heritage.org/welfare/report/understanding-the-hidden-11-trillion-welfare-system-and-how-reform-it)

- There are several welfare "cliffs" that can cause dramatic reductions in benefits for making just a few dollars more than the cutoff. This can create a barrier for those trying to move out of poverty, since they'll experience a sudden drop in net income.

## Replies to common misconceptions
- Recipients will waste the money given on frivolous things.
    - The [evidence](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/do-poor-waste-transfers-booze-and-cigarettes-no) mostly says that this is not the case. A meta-study on studies on alcohol and tobacco spending when individuals received conditional and unconditional cash transfers found that households tended to use the funds allocated for actual needs or for the suggested purposes that the cash was allocated for.
