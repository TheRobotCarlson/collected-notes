## Notes
Three propositions:

1.) Development space is merging with the "global space". We are globally interdependent. We are increasingly affect by more and more global forces.

2.) The development community is in its infancy with regards to new tools and approaches that are available for working in that larger global development space, meaning there are many opportunities for improvement.

3.) Development community should create new tools that make use of informed and empowered citizens in all countries to influence better local and global politics
    - don't underestimate citizens armed with good, shared information about important issues
    - empowering citizens can overcome some of the problems with waiting on change in politics


"there lies tremendous power in an informed and engaged citizenry. By instituting transparency and creating tools to make information freely available, we can empower an expanding and increasingly engaged global citizenry to hold governments to account."
