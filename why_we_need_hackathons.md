I've been a part of many hackathons over the years and have always felt like they greatly contribute to a growth in knowledge and innovation in the student body. They help expose students to new technologies, new people, and build skills in teamwork and meeting deadlines. I personally have been introduced to concepts and tools that I never would have used if it weren't for that hackathon and the project I worked on. Through hackathons, I've been introduced to a large body of knowledge
that I didn't realize needed exploring due to the way universities teach CS. I don't think students are properly prepared for the industry due to lack of exposure to ideas and technology. Hackathons help fix that problem.
